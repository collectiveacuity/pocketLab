## Roadmap Help
The generate.py script in docs_dev uses entries in docs_dev/components.yaml and the template file docs_dev/roadmap.md to automatically generate the components table. If you wish to update the roadmap page, make changes to the roadmap template file and to the entries in the components file. Then run generate.py to update those changes.
NOTE: If you make changes to docs/roadmap.md, they will be overwritten whenever you run generate.py
